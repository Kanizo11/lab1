1. I created the repository directly on GitHub using the web interface, which automatically initialized it as a Git repository. 

2. I made several commits using GitHub's built-in commit features including the "feat: Initial commit with student" commit.
 
3. I created a branch named "feature/student-details" to work on adding my student details separately from the main branch. Once my changes were complete, I merged this branch back into the main branch.

4. Created 3 files namely "student-info.txt" which contains my student ID and full name,"report.md" which outlines the steps taken in this assignment, "index.html" which contains a simple web page with the line "Hello world, I am 2570223".

5. I deployed the `index.html` file to GitHub Pages by firstly navigating to the repository settings on GitHub then enabling GitHub Pages and selecting the main branch as the source and lastly verifying that the site was accessible via the provided GitHub Pages URL.

6. I used Git locally to bundle the repository for submission. I executed the following command to create the submission file: ```bash git bundle create <student-id>-submission.bundle --all.
